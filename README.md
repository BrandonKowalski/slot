# Supported Devices

| Device             | Supported                  | Since Version |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Anbernic RG SP     | Yes                        | Always        |
| Anbernic RG34XX    | Yes                        | 1.4.0         |
| Anbernic RG34XXSP  | Yes (No Stick Support Yet) | 1.4.0         |
| Anbernic RG35XXSP  | Yes                        | 1.5.0         |
| Anbernic 35XX Plus | Yes                        | 1.5.0         |
| Anbernic RG28XX    | Yes                        | 1.6.0         |

RG28XX support was contributed by [GamerAnim](https://github.com/GamerAnim). Its panel is mounted
portrait, so slot turns the picture onto it. If it comes out upside down, add `export SLOT_ROTATE=ccw`
to `System/launch_frontend.sh`.

If you have one of the untested devices, or have tried slot on a device not listed,
please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/issues) and let me know how it went.

# AI Disclosure

The Rust frontend was put together by Claude Opus. I reviewed everything that was
produced. All documentation is 100% free-range, meatbag prose.

The project is extremely low stakes. I wanted a bespoke frontend for my RG SP and thought
that something that evokes the feeling of using my GBA SP as a kid would be pretty neat.

Use it, don't use it, I don't care.

Figured I should share the end result of all the wasted water. ✌🏻
